    <h4>How ChatGPT can help you write faster, and ways to use it</h4>

    <p> <br /> </p>
    <p>I got the idea to write about ChatGPT when my friend told me that it is plagiarism to use it for writing content. So I thought that people might think that it actually is, so let us first look at that.</p>
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <h5>What is ChatGPT?</h5>
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <p>ChatGPT is a Natural Pretrained Transformer that is built on AI technology. The most compelling thing about it is that it gives human-like responses.</p>
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <h5>Is it plagiarism if I use ChatGPT to write something?</h5>
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <p>I would argue yes and no. If you give a prompt that will write the whole text out for you, then technically, it is.</p>
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <p>If you use it strategically in your text, for example you get a writer block and ask ChatGPT for ideas to write about, then I would say it is fine, you are still learning and providing value. Let's say you want to write about “How plants changed through time”, and you don't know where to start, you could do something like this:</p>
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <img class="InsideBlogImage Full" src="img/ChatGPTQuestion.png" alt="Answer">
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <p>And the output would be this:</p>
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <img class="InsideBlogImage Full" src="img/ChatGPTAnswer.png" alt="Answer">
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <p>You get a complete potential action plan in front of you ready to be executed. In a freakishly human voice. It is insane how fast you can work with this tool. The important part is to learn how to write prompts correctly and clearly so ChatGPT can understand which output you are looking for. </p>
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <p>Remember to be clear in your writing, put the actions as you would execute yourself and see the magic. If you are a programmer, think of it in terms of coding, you have to write specific code for the system to understand what you want. The thing with ChatGPT is that you do not need to know how to code, but be precise in your speech.</p>
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <h5>How can I use ChatGPT in my writing?</h5>
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <p>Now you have your writing plan in front of you and you start writing only to realize you hit another roadblock and need some assistance quick because you want to finish this blog faster. </p> 
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <p> Let's say you are in the middle of explaining key plant innovations, such as development of roots, leaves and flowers as stated in the plan. In dire need of ideas, you go to ChatGPT and write a prompt: </p>
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <img class="InsideBlogImage Full" src="img/ChatGPTQuestionTwo.png" alt="Answer">
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <p>Notice how first we put in WHAT the output should be, second is how that output is STRUCTURED, and the third is the STYLE in which the text is written.</p>
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <p>So, to remember this:</p>
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <ul>
    <p>1.	Point of the prompt</p>
    <p>2.	Structure</p>
    <p>3.	Style (optional)</p>
    </ul>
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <p>The output of the prompt would be this:</p> 
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <img class="InsideBlogImage Full" src="img/ChatGPTAnswerTwo.png" alt="Answer">    
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <p>Again, the burden of looking for topics to write about is lifted, and you are free to dive into any topic you deem interesting for yourself and your audience.</p> 
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <h5>Can you write whole blogs with ChatGPT?</h5>
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <p>In short, yes. I would not recommend doing so though. Believe me, when it came out, the first thing in my mind was “I won't have to do any research! I can just write what I want to write and it is complete!”,  I was wrong, don't be fooled. It will lead to something like this: </p> 
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <ul>
        <p>1.	You write a prompt</p>
        <p>2.	Get the text</p>
        <p>3.	Change some words so you can say you wrote it</p>
        <p>4.	Learn almost nothing about the topic </p>
        <p>5.	Damage yourself and the reader</p>
        <p>6.	Do it again because it is easy</p>
    </ul>
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <p>Use it to get ideas, not final products. Ideas can produce multiple outcomes depending on the person performing the activity. </p> 
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <p>If you are looking to get a finished product from ChatGPT and never doing your own work, please don't use it. My previous blog was with ChatGPT. I only did it to prove it can be done. I encourage you to look at it after this.</p> 
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <p>Believe me or not, I probably spent less time writing this one than the one with ChatGPT, because of the time I spent checking for any wrong outputs, prompting to write sentences in different ways and prolonging the sentences to meet the word count.</p>
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <p>Trust me it is not worth the hassle for the quality of content it produces. You can do much better with some practice.</p> 
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <p>Also, don't forget to thank ChatGPT for the assistance, so it doesn't start hating you and stops replying without prior notice because you forgot about its feelings. (This is satire, but I still do it)</p>
